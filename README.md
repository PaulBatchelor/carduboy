# carduboy
Arduboy library de-implementation using C and Makefiles

This project requires make, gcc-avr, avr-libc, and avrdude.

To build, run "make".

To flash to arduboy, run "make flash".

With any luck, the demo program should show up on the
arduboy: a little box you can move around with the arrow
buttons.
